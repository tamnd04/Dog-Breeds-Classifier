4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: For all the test that I ran using the 4 uploaded images and the pet_images folder, I think the best model architecture for classifying images is VGG. Although the running time of VGG is 2 times longer than ResNet and 6 times longer than AlexNet but VGG's accuracy dominates the other two.
